# Intelligent Baghchal Agent AlphaZero

## Overview

Intelligent Baghchal Agent AlphaZero is a sophisticated system designed to play the traditional Nepali board game 'Bagh-Chal' using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. The project aims to create an intelligent game-playing agent capable of playing Bagh-Chal at a high level, promoting this unique cultural game globally.

## What is Bagh-Chal?

Bagh-Chal is a strategic, two-player board game originating from Nepal. The game is asymmetric: one player controls four tigers, and the other player controls up to twenty goats. The tigers hunt the goats while the goats attempt to block the tigers' movements.

## Intelligent Game Playing Agent

Intelligent game-playing agents are computer programs designed to play games at a high level, often surpassing human capabilities. These agents utilize various artificial intelligence techniques to make decisions, analyze situations, and strategize within the game's rules.

## Objectives

- **Develop an intelligent game-playing agent using reinforcement learning techniques to play Bagh-Chal like a human.**
- **Build an engaging single-player board game where the opponent is the intelligent system.**
- **Promote the traditional Nepali board game Bagh-Chal.**

## Literature Review

- **AlphaZero:** According to [1], AlphaZero, an algorithm initially created for Go but later adapted for chess and shogi, achieved remarkable results in all three games with minimal prior knowledge. This showcases significant progress towards creating a universal game-playing system capable of mastering any game.
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS):** MCTS is a popular search tree algorithm that works well with algorithms like Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Machine Learning Models [2].

## Methodology

### Agile Methodology

- **Iterative Cycles:** Development is broken down into iterative cycles, typically lasting one to three weeks.
- **Project Phases:** The project phases include Planning, Requirement Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, and Delivery.
- **Adaptability:** Agile methodology allows for adjustments and remodeling based on updated requirements, enabling the team to adapt to changes effectively.

### Why Agile?

- **Flexibility:** Allows for adjustments based on the importance of features in predicting outcomes.
- **Adaptation:** Facilitates the inclusion of new features that can influence the game's decision-making process.
